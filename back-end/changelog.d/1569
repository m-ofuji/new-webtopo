synopsis: Encode captures using toEncodedUrlPiece
prs: #1569
issues: #1511

description: {
The `servant-client` library now makes direct use of `toEncodedUrlPiece` from `ToHttpApiData`
to encode captured values when building the request path. It gives user freedom to implement
URL-encoding however they need.

Previous behavior was to use `toUrlPiece` and URL-encode its output using `toEncodedUrlPiece`
from the `Text` instance of `ToHttpApiData`. The issue with this approach is that
`ToHttpApiData Text` is overly zealous and also encodes characters, such as `*`, which are perfectly valid in a URL.
