synopsis: Allow IO in validationKeys
prs: #1580
issues: #1579

description: {

Currently validationKeys are a fixed JWKSet. This does not work with OIDC
providers such as AWS Cognito or Okta, which regularly fetching jwks_uri to
discover new and expired keys.

This change alters the type of validationKeys from JWKSet to IO JWKSet.
